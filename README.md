# Receive your SMS messages and phone calls directly in Telegram.

This project consists of two parts: software (this repository) and hardware (not uploaded yet).

As this is still in early development stages, I have not yet published instructions and schematics for the hardware part. Will do so once everything is set.

Using the following resources:

* Software:
  * Pyhon 3.7 or higher: http://python.org/
  * Pyrogram (Telegram client for Python): https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram

* Hardware:
  * 1x Raspberry Pi Zero 2W board (https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/).
  * 2x DC-DC converters (step-down).
  * 1x Bi-directional Level shifter.
  * 1x SIM800L module.
  * 1x Power supply (12v 5A).
  
  Please note that you will need to generate your own Telegram API key for this to work.
  
  For that, please refer to the official documentation: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id
  
  Please do create issues/pull requests if something is not working for you.
  
  Hope it serves you well!
